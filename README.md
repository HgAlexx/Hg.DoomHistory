## About

This is not the prettiest source code in the world, I've made this software over the course of a week and there is still a lot of room for improvements.

I got the idea while watching [IAmAllstin](https://www.twitch.tv/iamallstin) streaming doom. He was spending a lot of time copy/pasting save files to be able to pratice part of the game for his Ultra-Nightmare run.

Since I was also planning to do Doom on Ultra-Nightmare, I was going to need a way to back my save files too.
